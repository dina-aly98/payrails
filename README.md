#This is my case study for Question 1. This is the first time I've utilized any of these tools. Appreciate your patience.

# Payrails Product Assessment

This repository contains the Postman collection and setup required to complete the Payrails card tokenization flow using Client Side Encryption.

## âœ… Completed Steps

1. **Request Access Token**  
   Using client ID and API key to obtain a mock access token from Mockoon.

2. **Initialize Client SDK**  
   Fetched public key and holder reference from `/client/sdk`.

3. **Encrypt Card Details**  
   Used JWE (RSA-OAEP-256 + A256CBC-HS512) to encrypt test card data.

4. **Tokenize Card**  
   Sent encrypted payload to `/instruments` endpoint to simulate tokenization.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

- **Postman** â€” To manage and send API requests  
- **Mockoon** â€” To simulate Payrails backend API  
- **Online JWE Encryptor / Python** â€” To generate JWE encrypted payload
- **ChatGPT** â€” To guide me through the case study


## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Payrails.postman_collection.json`: The full Postman collection used in this project.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Mockoon environment includes all necessary mocked endpoints (`/auth/token`, `/client/sdk`, `/instruments`).
- All bearer tokens and API keys used are mock values for testing only.
